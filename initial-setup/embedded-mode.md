# Embedded Mode

We will be creating a new application based on one of the archetypes we installed in the last section. To that we will use the JBoss Developer studio.

Using **JBoss Developer Studio** \(JBDS\) menu:

1. Choose File ðŸ¡’ New ðŸ¡’ Other ðŸ¡’ Maven ðŸ¡’ Maven Project and click Next two times
2. In the **Filter** type in `org.everythingjboss.mw` and ensure that **Include snapshot archetypes** checkbox is selected
3. Select the **infinispan-embedded-archetype** and click Next
4. Fill in the groupId, artifactId and version for your new project and click on Finish
5. Right click on the only Java class name, **JDGConsoleApp**, in the package explorer and click Run As ðŸ¡’ Java Application
6. If the execution in \#5 didn't fail for any reason, then the project worked. Your instructor will help you set the expectation around the output
