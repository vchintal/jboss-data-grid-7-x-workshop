# Initial Setup

Git clone the repo [https://github.com/vchintal/jboss-middleware-archetypes.git](https://github.com/vchintal/jboss-middleware-archetypes) either from command-line or use JBoss Developer Studio to clone the project into your workspace.

### From Command-Line

```bash
 git clone https://github.com/vchintal/jboss-middleware-archetypes.git
```

### From JBoss Developer Studio

1. Using the menu, choose File ðŸ¡’ Import ðŸ¡’ Maven ðŸ¡’ Checkout Maven Projects from SCM
2. Copy-paste the above URL, click next till the end
3. Right-click on **jboss-middleware-archetypes**, choose Run As ðŸ¡’ 6 Maven Install

Follow the instructions below to further run setup instructions based on the operational mode of your choice.

### Cataloging the Archetypes

In some circumstances, the archetypes are installed but not cataloged and hence the JBoss Developer Studio \(JBDS\) cannot find them. If JBDS cannot find the archetypes, you cannot create a project from them using it. So here is some workaround:

1. Run the command `mvn archetype:crawl` on the command line
2. It should create a file `~/.m2/repository/archetype-catalog.xml` . That is on my system it created `/home/vchintal/.m2/repository/archetype-catalog.xml`. Make a note of it and move to next step
3. Using JBDS, navigate to, Window ðŸ¡’ Preferences ðŸ¡’ Maven ðŸ¡’ Archetypes ðŸ¡’ Add Local Catalog. Paste the full path to your archetype-catalog.xml and save it

## Embedded Mode {#embedded-mode}

We will be creating a new application based on one of the archetypes we installed in the last section. To that we will use the JBoss Developer studio.

Using **JBoss Developer Studio **\(JBDS\) menu:

1. Choose File ðŸ¡’ New ðŸ¡’ Other ðŸ¡’ Maven ðŸ¡’ Maven Project and click Next two times
2. In the **Filter** type in `org.everythingjboss.mw` and ensure that **Include snapshot archetypes ** checkbox is selected
3. Select the **infinispan-embedded-archetype** and click Next
4. Fill in the groupId, artifactId and version for your new project and click on Finish
5. Right click on the only Java class name, **JDGConsoleApp**, in the package explorer and click Run As ðŸ¡’ Java Application
6. If the execution in \#5 didn't fail for any reason, then the project worked. Your instructor will help you set the expectation around the output

## Client-Server Mode {#client-server-mode}

We will be creating a new JDG \(server\) client application based on one of the archetypes we installed in the last section. But before could run the application we need to setup the JDG server. Follow the steps shown below in order to finish the setup.

### Download/Install the JDG server

Download the JDG server binary from the either the [Customer Portal](https://access.redhat.com/jbossnetwork/restricted/listSoftware.html?product=data.grid&downloadType=distributions) or from [developers.redhat.com](https://developers.redhat.com/download-manager/file/jboss-datagrid-7.1.0-server.zip)

1. Unzip the folder to a chosen path. Let us refer to the unzipped path ending with `jboss-datagrid-7.1.0-server` as `$JDG_HOME`. On Linux this can be achieved with the following command:

   ```
   export JDG_HOME=/path/to/jboss-datagrid-7.1.0-server
   ```

2. If using the **Customer Portal**, download and save the [Red Hat JBoss Data Grid 7.1.2 Server Update](https://access.redhat.com/jbossnetwork/restricted/softwareDownload.html?softwareId=56221). Run the server update by following the steps below

   ```
   # Start the JDG server in one terminal with the following command
   $JDG_HOME/bin/standalone.sh 

   # In another terminal with JDG_HOME environment variable set, run 
   # the CLI command 
   $JDG_HOME/bin/cli.sh --connect --controller=127.0.0.1:9990

   # Once logged into CLI run the following command
   [standalone@127.0.0.1:9990 /] patch apply /path/to/jboss-datagrid-7.1.1-server-patch.zip

   # Then shutdown the JDG instance 
   [standalone@127.0.0.1:9990 /] shutdown
   ```

### Create a new JDG Client app

Using **JBoss Developer Studio **\(JBDS\) menu:

1. Choose File ðŸ¡’ New ðŸ¡’ Other ðŸ¡’ Maven ðŸ¡’ Maven Project and click Next two times
2. In the **Filter** type in `org.everythingjboss.mw` and ensure that **Include snapshot archetypes ** checkbox is selected
3. Select the **infinispan-server-client-archetype** and click Next
4. Fill in the groupId, artifactId and version for your new project and click on Finish
5. Right click on the only Java class name, **JDGRemoteClientConsoleApp**, in the package explorer and click Run As ðŸ¡’ Java Application
6. If the execution in \#5 didn't fail for any reason, then the project setup worked. Your instructor will help you set the expectation around the output

### Run the client app

For the client app to be successful we must test against an running server, so let's follow the steps below in order to run the client application:

1. In the project folder, using command-line, ensure that the **JDG\_HOME** environment variable is set as shown above and run the command : `mvn wildfly:start` to start the JDG server
2. Once the above command finishes, run the Java main class **JDGRemoteClientConsoleApp** either from the JBDS by right-clicking on its name in package explorer and clicking Run As ðŸ¡’ Java Application or by running the command `mvn compile exec:exec` in the project's root folder.
3. If the command went thru without exceptions, then the project setup worked. Your instructor will help you set the expectation around the output
