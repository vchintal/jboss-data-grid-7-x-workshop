# JBoss Data Grid 7.x Workshop

JBoss Data Grid \(JDG in short\) is an In-Memory Enterprise Caching solution from Red Hat, Inc. JDG is :

* A distributed &lt;K,V&gt; \(key-value\) based store where the contents live in-memory of JDG instances  
* Allows for large volumes of data \(hundreds of GBs\) to be stored in a cluster
* Elastic scaling and redistribution of data as more instances are added or removed from the cluster
* Querying functionality to query stored values based on their attributes when key\(s\) are unavailable
* Role Based Access Control \(RBAC\) on cache entities which clearly define _who are allowed to do what operations on the cache_
* Distributed execution of tasks \(such a Map/Reduce\) over cluster content ensuring the tasks are migrated and executed on JDG instances where the data resides
* and much more ...
