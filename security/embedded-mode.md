# Embedded Mode

In the embedded mode, since the cache resides within the application, the security of the cache is driven by the security around the app itself. Since there are numerous ways to protect a webapp with its container security than console based app, we will refer to a demo your presenter will run using the quickstart that can be found [here](https://github.com/vchintal/secure-embedded-cache-quickstart).

In this demo we will secure a simple webapp with authentication/authorization and use that to drive the operations on the cache.
