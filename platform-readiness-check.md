# Prerequisites

## **Java Development Kit 8 ** installed

* Environment variable `JAVA_HOME` is set to the path where JDK is installed.

  * On Linux \(feel free to put this in your .bashrc or .kshrc\) this could be done with the following command:

    ```
    # Shown as an example, please use the right JDK installation path
    export JAVA_HOME=/usr/java/jdk1.8.0_144
    ```

  * On Windows

    * Search for **Environment Variables** from the Desktop. If that cannot be done, navigate to Control Panel ðŸ¡’ System and Security ðŸ¡’ System ðŸ¡’ \(click on\) Advanced System Settings ðŸ¡’ Advanced \(tab\) ðŸ¡’ \(click on\) Environment Variables 
    * In the window that came up, under the section_ _**User variables for**, click on the New and add **JAVA\_HOME **as the the variable and the path as the value

* `bin` folder of Java home \(JAVA\_HOME\) is on the path.

  * On Linux \(feel free to put this in your .bashrc or .kshrc\) :

    ```
    export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH
    ```

  * On Windows

    * Following the same steps as above for JAVA\_HOME but this time as the last step in the window that got launched, work with the section titled **System Variables**. In that section find the variable by the name **Path** and click open it

    * Edit the value by prepending `%JAVA_HOME%\bin;` to the beginning of the line

* Verify the setup by running the command `java -version` on the command-line. On Windows, you have to launch a new command-line session.

## **Maven **installed

* Environment variable `M2_HOME` set to path where Maven is installed.

  * On Linux this could be done with the following command:

    ```bash
    # Shown as an example, please use the right Maven installation path
    export M2_HOME=/usr/share/maven
    ```

  * On Windows, follow the same steps as for JAVA_\_\_HOME and this time use the varibale_ _M2_\_\_HOME and set value to the maven's installed path

* `bin` folder of Maven's home \(M2\_HOME\) is on the path:

  * On Linux:

    ```bash
    export PATH=$M2_HOME/bin:$PATH
    ```

  * On Windows, follow the same steps as you followed to put the `%JAVA_HOME%\bin` on the path

* Verify the setup by running the command `mvn -version` on the command-line. On Windows, you have to launch a new command-line session.

## **JBoss Developer Studio ** installed

* Download the binary as `.jar` from [here](https://developers.redhat.com/products/devstudio/download/)
* Run the installation by executing the following command:
  ```bash
  java -jar /path/to/devstudio-11.2.0.GA-installer-standalone.jar
  ```
* Launch the JBoss Developer Studio and as a ideal optional step, create a new worspace by clicking on the menu File ðŸ¡’ Switch Workspace and type in the desired path and name of the workspace. This is a way to protect your current projects if any in the current workspace.
